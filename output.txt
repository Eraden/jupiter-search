[0 - 970]:  Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 264, recorded on October 26, 2022.
[970 - 1088]:  I'm Chris.
[1088 - 1188]:  And I'm Wes.
[1188 - 1288]:  Hello Wes.
[1288 - 1456]:  Let's do the news.
[1456 - 1854]:  Canonical announced Ubuntu 22.10 this week.
[1854 - 2400]:  Codenamed Kinetic Kudu, this interim release seems to have a particular focus on the Raspberry
[2400 - 2500]:  Pi.
[2500 - 2640]:  I don't mind that at all.
[2640 - 3180]:  Ubuntu 22.10 now supports a MicroPython goodness on various microcontrollers, including the
[3180 - 3448]:  Raspberry Pi Pico W.
[3448 - 4084]:  Also, the Ubuntu graphics stack has transitioned to KMS, meaning developers can run Pi-based
[4084 - 4530]:  graphical applications, say using something like Qt, without a desktop session and without
[4530 - 4672]:  Pi-specific drivers.
[4672 - 5016]:  You can see that's great for a lot of hardware installations.
[5016 - 5420]:  This complements also expanded support in this release of Ubuntu for all kinds of displays
[5420 - 6048]:  like E-Ink Hat series, the HyperPixel range, and even the Raspberry Pi official touchscreen.
[6048 - 6808]:  The GNOME desktop was updated to version 43, which includes GTK4 theming for improved performance.
[6808 - 7412]:  And Pipewire also becomes the default audio system with 22.10, along with Wireplumber
[7412 - 8100]:  as the session manager, making this now a common stack across modern Linux desktops.
[8100 - 8590]:  And finally, an area that Canonical was drawing special attention to is their new Steam Snap.
[8590 - 9088]:  They noted that it includes the latest Mesa, presumably with the ability to decode video,
[9088 - 9440]:  and gamers can now be confident they'll always be up to date, regardless of their
[9440 - 9940]:  host OS, without needing to configure any of those gross PPAs that somebody came up
[9940 - 10040]:  with.
[10040 - 10420]:  And you know, maybe this isn't absolutely necessary on an interim release like this
[10420 - 10852]:  particular one, but you could see how this Snap is going to be very useful on future
[10852 - 10952]:  LTS releases.
[10952 - 11324]:  But you can hear more of our thoughts on the overall release in Linux Unplugged episode
[11324 - 12000]:  481.
